                            <p>Cerebellar hypoplasia is a developmental condition in which the cerebellum of the brain fails to develop properly</p>

                    <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                    <p>Puppies affected by hereditary and/or congenital causes of cerebellar hypoplasia tend to display symptoms of this disease very early on, usually as soon as theyâ€™re able to ambulate. Kittens, however, will usually be symptomatic at birth.
                        <p>Tremors, head bobbing, generalized lack of balance and coordination, exaggerated movements (especially when ambulating), and a wide stance are all observed.</p>

                    <p>While there is no cure or treatment for this condition, as your puppy grows-up they can learn to compensate for their condition and go on to live a long, happy, and pain free life. Pets with cerebellar hypoplasia can often benefit from the use of a dog wheelchair to help support them and keep them mobile.</p>
